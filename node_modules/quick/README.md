quickjs
=======

Description
-----------

quickjs is a web application framework, including a declarative language,
offline compiler to render JavaScript and an engine to run the generated code.

The declarative language is heavily influenced by QtQuick's QML language, with
adjustments to fit the HTML5 space.


Installation
------------

The 'build.sh' script in the project root, will generate the 'quick.js' library
together with a minified version of it.

There is also a nodejs module, which contains the offline compiler scripts.
$> npm install quick

Examples

There are several examples, on how to use quickjs in a browser and node environment,
located in the examples subfolder.
